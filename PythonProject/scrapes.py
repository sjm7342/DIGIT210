CHAPTER
ONE

We
were in the
study - hall
when
the
headmaster
entered,
followed
by
a
new
boy
not yet in school
uniform and by
the
handy
man
carrying
a
large
desk.Their
arrival
disturbed
the
slumbers
of
some
of
us, but
we
all
stood
up in our
places as
though
rising
from our work.

The
headmaster
motioned
us
to
be
seated, then, turning
to
the
teacher:

"Monsieur Roger,"
he
said in an
undertone, "here's a
pupil
I
'd like you to keep your eye on.  I'
m
putting
him in
the
last
year
of
the
lower
school.If
he
does
good
work and
behaves
himself
we
'll move him up to where he ought to be at
his
age.
"

The
newcomer, who
was
hanging
back in the
corner
so
that
the
door
half
hid
him
from view, was

a
country
lad
of
about
fifteen, taller
than
any
of
us.He
had
his
hair
cut
in bangs
like
a
cantor in a
village
church, and he
had
a
gentle, timid
look.He
wasn
't broad in the shoulders, but
his
green
jacket
with its black buttons seemed tight under
the
arms; and through
the
vents
of
his
cuffs
we
could
see
red
wrists
that
were
clearly
unaccustomed
to
being
covered.His
yellowish
breeches
were
hiked
up
by
his
suspenders, and from

them
emerged
a
pair
of
blue - stockinged
legs.He
wore
heavy
shoes, hobnailed and badly
shined.

We
began
to
recite
our
lessons.He
listened
avidly, as
though
to
a
sermon, he
didn
't dare even cross his legs or
lean
on
his
elbows, and at
two
o
'clock, when the bell rang
for the next class, the teacher had to tell him to line up
with the rest of us.

We
always
flung
our
caps
on
the
floor
when
entering
a
classroom, to
free
our
hands.We
hurled
them
under
the
seats
from the doorway

itself, in such
a
way
that
they
struck
the
wall and raised
a
cloud
of
dust.That
was
"how it was done."

But
whether
he
had
failed
to
notice
this
ritual or had
not dared
join in observance
of
it, his
cap
was
still in his
lap
when
we
'd finished reciting our prayer.  It was a head-
gear
of
composite
order, containing
elements
of
an
ordinary
hat, a
hussar
's busby, a lancer'
s
cap, a
sealskin
cap, and a
nightcap;
one
of
those
wretched
things
whose
mute
hideousness
suggests
unplumbed
depths, like
an
idiot
's face.  Ovoid and
stiffened
with whalebone, it began with three convex strips,
then
followed
alternating
lozenges
of
velvet and rabbit
's fur,
separated
by
a
red
band.Then
came
a
kind
of
bag, terminating
in a
cardboard - lined
polygon
intricately
decorated
with braid.
    From
    this
    hung
    a
    long, excessively
    thin
    cord
    ending in a
    kind
of
tassel
of
gold
netting.The
cap
was
new, its
peak
was
shiny.

"Stand up,"
said
the
teacher.

He
rose.His
cap
dropped
to
the
floor.Everyone
began
to
laugh.

He
bent
over
for it.A boy beside him sent it down again
with his elbow.Once again he picked it up.

"How about getting rid of your helmet?"
suggested
the
teacher, who
was
something
of
a
wit.

Another
loud
laugh
from the students

confused
the
poor
fellow.He
didn
't know whether to keep the cap in his hand,
drop
it
on
the
floor, or put
it
on
his
head.He
sat
down
again and placed
it in his
lap.

"Stand up,"
repeated
the
professor, "and tell me your
name.
"

The
new
boy
mumbled
a
name
that
was
unintelligible.

"Say it again!"

The
same
jumble
of
syllables
came
out, drowned in the
jeers
of
the


class .

    "Louder!"
    cried
    the
    teacher.
    "Louder!"

    With
    desperate
    resolve
    the
    new
    boy
    opened
    a
    mouth
    that


seemed
enormous, and as though
calling
someone
he
cried
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
the
word
"Charbovari!"

This
touched
off
a
roar
that
rose
crescendo, punctuated
with shrill screams.There was a shrieking, a banging of
desks as everyone
yelled, "Charbovari!  Charbovari!"
Then
the
din
broke
up
into
isolated
cries
that
slowly
diminished,
occasionally
starting
up
again
along
a
line
of
desks
where
a
stifled
laugh
would
burst
out
here and there
like
a
half -
spent
firecracker.

But
a
shower
of
penalties
gradually
restored
order, and
the
teacher, finally grasping
the
name
Charles
Bovary
after
it
had
been
several
times
spelled
out and repeated and he
had
read
it
aloud
himself, at
once
commanded
the
poor
devil
to
sit in the
dunce
's seat, at the foot of the platform.  He
began
to
move
toward
it, then
hesitated.

"What are you looking for?"
the
teacher
demanded.

"My c--"
the
new
boy
said
timidly, casting
an
uneasy
glance
around
him.

"Everybody will stay and write five hundred lines!"

Like
Neptune
's "Quos ego," those words, furiously
uttered, cut
short
the
threat
of
a
new
storm.
"Quiet!"
the
indignant
teacher
continued, mopping
his
forehead
with a
    handkerchief
    he
    took
    from his toque."As for you,"
    he
    said
to
the
new
boy, "you'll copy out for me twenty times all the
tenses
of
ridiculus
sum.
"

Then, more
gently, "You'll find your cap.  No one has
stolen
it.
"

All
was
calm
again.Heads
bent
over
copybooks, and for
    the
next
two
hours
the
new
boy
's conduct was exemplary, even
though
an
occasional
spitball, sent
from the nib

of
a
pen,
struck
him
wetly in the
face.He
wiped
himself
each
time
with his hand, and otherwise sat there motionless, his eyes
lowered.

That
evening, in study
period, he
took
his
sleeveguards
from his desk, arranged

his
meager
equipment, and carefully
ruled
his
paper.We
saw
him
working
conscientiously, looking
up
every
word in the
dictionary, taking
great
pains.It
was
doubtless
thanks
to
this
display
of
effort
that
he
was
not
demoted
to
a
lower
form.For
while he had a fair knowledge
of
grammatical
rules, his
translations
lacked
elegance.He
had
begun
his
Latin
with this village priest.His thrifty
parents
had
sent
him
away
to
school as late as possible.

His
father, Monsieur
Charles - Denis - Bartholome
Bovary,
had
been
an
army
surgeon
's aide, forced to leave the service
about
1812 as a
result
of
involvement in a
conscription
scandal.He
had
then
turned
his
personal
charms
to
advantage,
picking
up
a
dowry
of
60, 000
francs
brought
to
him
by
a
knit -
goods
dealer
's daughter who had fallen in love with his
appearance.He
was
a
handsome
man, much
given
to
bragging and
clanking
his
spurs.His
side
whiskers
merged
with his
    mustache, his
    fingers
    were
    always
    loaded
    with rings, his
        clothes
    were
    flashy.He
    had
    the
    look
    of
    a
    bully and the
    easy
cajoling
ways
of
a
traveling
salesman.Once
married, he
lived
off
his
wife
's money for two or three years.  He ate
well, rose
late, smoked
big
porcelain
pipes, stayed
out
every
night
to
see
a
show, spent
much
of
his
time in cafes.His
father - in -law
died and left
very
little.This
made
him
indignant, and he
"went into textiles" and lost
some
money.
Then
he
retired
to
the
country,
with the intention of "making
things
pay.
"  But he knew as little about crops as he did
about
calico, and since
he
rode
his
horses
instead
of
working
them in the
fields, drank
his
cider
bottled
instead
of
selling
it
by
the
barrel, ate
his
best
poultry, and greased
his
hunting
boots
with the fat from his pigs, he soon realized
that
the
had
better
give
up
all
idea
of
profit - making.

So
for two hundred francs a year he rented, in a village
on
the
border
of
Normandy and Picardy, a
dwelling
that
was
half
farm, half
gentleman
's residence, and there, surly,
eaten
by
discontent, cursing
heaven, envying
everyone, he
shut
himself
up
at
the
age
of
forty - five, disgusted
with
    mankind, he
    said, and resolved
    to
    live in peace.

His
wife
had
been
mad
about
him
at
the
beginning.In
her
love
she
had
tendered
him
a
thousand
servilities
that
had
alienated
him
all
the
more.Once
sprightly, all
outgoing
and affectionate,
with age she had grown touchy, nagging and
nervous, like
stale
wine
turning
to
vinegar.At
first
she
had
suffered
uncomplainingly, watching
him
chase
after
every
trollop in the
village and having
him
come
back
to
her
at
night
from any one

of
twenty
disgusting
places
surfeited and
stinking
of
drink.Then
her
pride
rebelled.She
withdrew
into
her
shell, and swallowing
her
rage
she
bore
up
stoically
until
her
death.She
was
always
busy, always
doing
things.
She
was
constantly
running
to
lawyers, to
the
judge, remember -
ing
when
notes
fell
due and obtaining
renewals.And
at
home
she
was
forever
ironing, sewing, washing, keeping
an
eye
on
the
hired
men, figuring
their
wages.Monsieur, meanwhile,
never
lifted
a
finger.He
sat
smoking in the
chimney
corner
and spitting
into
the
ashes, continually
falling
into
a
grumpy
doze and waking
to
utter
uncomplimentary
remarks.

When
she
had
a
child
it
had
to
be
placed
out
with a wet
nurse.And
then
later, when
the
little
boy
was
back
with
    its
    parents, he
    was
    pampered
    like
    a
    prince.His
    mother
stuffed
him
with jams and jellies.His father let him run
barefoot, and fancied
himself
a
disciple
of
Rousseau
to
the
point
of
saying
he
'd be quite willing to have the boy go
naked
like
a
young
animal.To
counter
his
wife
's maternal
tendencies
he
tried
to
form
his
son
according
to
a
certain
virile
ideal
of
childhood and to
harden
his
constitution
by
subjecting
him
to
strict
discipline, Spartan - style.He
sent
him
to
bed
without
a
fire, taught
him
to
take
great
swigs
of
rum and to
ridicule
religious
processions.But
the
child
was
pacific
by
nature, and such
training
had
little
effect.
His
mother
kept
him
tied
to
her
apron - strings.She
made
him
paper
cutouts, told
him
stories, and conversed
with him in
    endless
    bitter - sweet
    monologues
    full
    of
    coaxing
    chatter.In
the
isolation
of
her
life
she
transferred
to
her
baby
all
her
own
poor
frustrated
ambitions.She
dreamed
of
glamorous
careers, She
saw
him
tall, handsome, witty, successful, a
bridge
builder or a
judge.She
taught
him
to
read, and even,
on
an
old
piano
she
had, to
sing
two or three
sentimental
little
songs.But
from Monsieur Bovary, who

cared
little
for culture, all this brought merely the comment that it was
"useless."
Could
they
ever
afford
to
give
him
an
education,
to
buy
him
a
practice or a
business?  Besides, "with enough
nerve
a
man
could
always
get
ahead in the
world.
"  Madame
Bovary
pursed
her
lips, and the
boy
ran
wild in the
village.

He
followed
the
hired
men and chased
crows, pelting
them
with clods of earth until they flew off.He ate the
wild
blackberries
that
grew
along
the
ditches, looked
after
the
turkeys
with a long stick, pitched hay, roamed the woods,
played
hopscotch in the
shelter
of
the
church
porch
when
it
rained, and on
important
feast - days
begged
the
sexton
to
let
him
toll
the
bells
so
that
he
could
hang
with his full weight
from the heavy

rope and feel
it
sweep
him
off
his
feet as it
swung in its
arc.

He
throve
like
an
oak.His
hands
grew
strong and his
complexion
ruddy.

When
he
was
twelve, his
mother
had
her
way.He
began
his
studies.The
priest
was
asked
to
tutor
him.But
the
lessons
were
so
short and irregular
that
they
served
little
purpose.They
took
place
at
odd
hurried
moments.In
the
sacristy
between
a
baptism and a
funeral.Or else the
priest
would
send
for him after the Angelus, when his parish
business
was
over
for the day.They would go up to his
bedroom and begin, midges and moths
fluttering
around
the
candle.There in the
warmth
the
child
would
fall
asleep,
and the
old
man, too, would
soon
be
dozing and snoring, his
hands
folded
over
his
stomach and his
mouth
open.Other
times, as Monsieur
le
cure
was
returning
from a sick

-bed
with the holy oils, he would catch sight of Charles
scampering in the
fields, and would
call
him
over and
lecture
him
for a few minutes, taking advantage of the
occasion
to
make
him
conjugate
a
verb
right
there, under
a
tree.Rain
would
interrupt
them, or some
passer - by
whom
they
knew.However, he
was
always
satisfied
with him, and
even
said
that
"the young fellow had a good memory."

Things
weren
't allowed to stop there.  Madame was
persistent.Shamed
into
consent; or, rather, his
resistance
worn
down, Monsieur
gave in without
further
struggle.They
waited
a
year, until
the
boy
had
made
his
First
Communion,
then
six
months
more, and finally Charles
was
sent
to
the
lycee in Rouen.His
father
delivered
him
himself, toward
the
end
of
October, during
the
fortnight
of
the
Saint - Romain
fair.

It
would
be
very
difficult
today
for any of us to say
what
he
was
like.There
was
nothing
striking
about
him.He
played
during
recess, worked in study - hall, paid
attention
in

class , slept soundly in the dormitory, ate heartily in


the
refectory.His
local
guardian
was
a
wholesale
hardware
dealer in the
rue
Ganterie, who
called
for him one Sunday a
month
after
early
closing, sent
him
for a walk along the
riverfront
to
look
at
the
boats, then
brought
him
back
to
school
by
seven, in time
for supper.Every Thursday night
Charles
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
mother, using
red
ink and
three
seals.Then
he
looked
over
his
history
notes, or
leafed
through
an
old
volume
of
Anacharsis
that
lay
around
the
study - hall.When
his


class went for outings he talked


with the school servant who accompanied them, a countryman
like
himself.

By
working
hard
he
managed
to
stay
about in the
middle
of
the


class .  Once he even got an honorable mention in


natural
history.But
before
he
finished
upper
school
his
parents
took
him
out
of
the
lycee
entirely and sent
him
to
study
medicine, confident
that
he
could
get
his
baccalaureate
degree
anyway
by
making
up
the
intervening
years
on
his
own.

His
mother
chose
a
room
for him, four flights up over-
looking
the
stream
called
the
Eau - de - Robec, in the
house
of
a
dyer
she
knew.She
arranged
for his board, got him a table
and two
chairs, and sent
home
for an old cherry bed.And to
keep
her
darling
warm
she
bought
him
a
small
cast - iron
stove
and a
load
of
wood.Then
after
a
week
she
went
back
to
her
village, urging
him
a
thousand
times
over
to
behave
himself
now
that
he
was
on
his
own.

The
curriculum
that
he
read
on
the
bulletin
board
staggered
him.Courses in anatomy, pathology, pharmacy,
chemistry, botany, clinical
practice, therapeutics, to
say
nothing
of
hygiene and materia
medica.Names
of
unfamiliar
etymology
that
were
like
so
many
doors
leading
to
solemn
shadowy
sanctuaries.

He
understood
absolutely
nothing
of
any
of
it.He
listened in vain.He
could
not grasp
it.Even
so, he
worked.He
filled
his
notebooks, attended
every
lecture,
never
missed
hospital
rounds.In
the
performance
of
his
daily
task
he
was
like
a
mill - horse
that
treads
blindfolded in a
circle, utterly
ignorant
of
what
he is grinding.

To
save
him
money, his
mother
sent
him
a
roast
of
veal
each
week
by
the
stagecoach, and off
this
he
lunched
when
he
came in
from the hospital, warming

his
feet
by
beating
them
against
the
wall.Then
he
had
to
hurry
off
to
lectures, to
the
amphitheatre, to
another
hospital, crossing
the
entire
city
again
when
he
returned.At
night, after
eating
the
meager
dinner
his
landlord
provided, he
climbed
back
up
to
his
room, back
to
work.Steam
rose
from his damp

clothes as
he
sat
beside
the
red - hot
stove.

On
fine
summer
evenings, at
the
hour
when
the
warm
streets
are
empty and servant
girls
play
at
shuttlecock in
front
of
the
houses, he
would
open
his
window and lean
out.
The
stream, which
makes
this
part
of
Rouen
a
kind
of
squalid
little
Venice, flowed
just
below, stained
yellow, purple or
blue
between
its
bridges and railings.Workmen
from the dye

plants, crouching
on
the
bank, washed
their
arms in the
water.Above
him, on
poles
projecting
from attics, skeins

of
cotton
were
drying in the
open.And
beyond
the
roof - tops
stretched
the
sky, vast and pure,
with the red sun setting.
How
good
it
must
be in the
country!  How
cool in the
beech
grove!  And
he
opened
his
nostrils
wide, longing
for a whiff
    of
    the
    fresh and fragrant
    air, but
    none
    was
    ever
    wafted
    to
where
he
was.

He
grew
thinner and taller, and his
face
took
on
a
kind
of
plaintive
expression
that
almost
made
it
interesting.

The
fecklessness
that
was
part
of
his
nature
soon
led
him
to
break
all
his
good
resolutions.One
day
he
skipped
rounds, the
next, a
lecture.Idleness, he
found, was
to
his
taste, and gradually
he
stayed
away
entirely.

He
began
to
go
to
cafes.Soon
he
was
crazy
about
dominoes.To
spend
his
evenings
shut
up in a
dirty
public
room, clinking
black - dotted
pieces
of
sheep
's bone on a
marble
table, seemed
to
him
a
marvelous
assertion
of
his
freedom
that
raised
him in his
own
esteem.It
was
like
an
initiation
into
the
world, admission
to
a
realm
of
forbidden
delights, and every
time
he
entered
the
cafe
the
feel
of
the
doorknob in his
hand
gave
him
a
pleasure
that
was
almost
sensual.Now
many
things
pent
up
within
him
burst
their
bonds.He
learned
verses
by
heart and sang
them
at
student
gatherings, developed
an
enthusiasm
for Beranger, learned to
    make
    punch, and knew, at
    long
    last, the
    joys
    of
    love.

Thanks
to
that
kind
of
preparation
he
failed
completely
the
examination
that
would
have
entitled
him
to
practice
medicine as an
offcier
de
sante.And
his
parents
were
waiting
for him at home that very night at celebrate his success!

He
set
out
on
foot.At
the
outskirts
of
the
village
he
stopped, sent
someone
for his mother, and told her all.
She
forgave
him, laying
his
downfall
to
the
unfairness
of
the
examiners, and steadied
him
by
promising
to
make
all
explanations.(It
was
five
years
before
Monsieur
Bovary
learned
the
truth.By
that
time
it
was
an
old
story and he
could
accept
it, especially
since
he
couldn
't conceive of
his
own
offspring as being
stupid.)

Charles
set
to
work
again and crammed
ceaselessly,
memorizing
everything
on
which
he
could
possibly
be
questioned.He
passed
with a fairly good grade.What a
wonderful
day
for his mother!  Everyone was asked to dinner.

Where
should
he
practice?  At
Tostes.In
that
town
there
was
only
one
elderly
doctor, whose
death
Madame
Bovary
had
long
been
waiting
for , and the old man hadn't yet
breathed
his
last
when
Charles
moved in across
the
road as
his
successor.

But
it
wasn
't enough to have raised her son, sent him
into
medicine, and discovered
Tostes
for him to practice in.
He
had
to
have
a
wife.She
found
him
one, a
huissier
's
widow in Dieppe, forty - five
years
old,
with twelve hundred
francs
a
year.

Ugly
though
she
was, and thin as a
lath,
with a face as
spotted as a
meadow in springtime, Madame
Dubuc
unquestionably
had
plenty
of
suitors
to
choose
from .To gain

her
ends
Madame
Bovary
had
to
get
rid
of
all
the
rivals, and her
outwitting
of
one
of
them, a
butcher
whose
candidacy
was
favored
by
the
local
clergy, was
nothing
short
of
masterly.

Charles
had
envisaged
marriage as the
beginning
of
a
better
time, thinking
that
he
would
have
greater
freedom and
be
able
to
do as he
liked
with himself and his money.But
it
was
his
wife
who
ruled.In
front
of
company
he
had
to
say
certain
things and not others, he
had
to
eat
fish
on
Friday,
dress
the
way
she
wanted, obey
her
when
she
ordered
him
to
dun
nonpaying
patients.She
opened
his
mail, watched
his
every
move, and listened
through
the
thinness
of
the
wall
when
there
were
women in his
office.

She
had
to
have
her
cup
of
chocolate
every
morning.
There
was
no
end
to
the
attentions
she
required.She
complained
incessantly
of
her
nerves, of
pains in her
chest,
of
depressions and faintnesses.The
sound
of
anyone
moving
about
near
her
made
her
ill.When
people
left
her
she
couldn
't
bear
her
loneliness.When
they
came
to
see
her
it
was, of
course, "to watch her die."
When
Charles
came
home in the
evening
she
would
bring
her
long
thin
arms
out
from under

her
bedclothes, twine
them
around
his
neck, draw
him
down
beside
her
on
the
edge
of
the
bed, and launch
into
the
tale
of
her
woes.He
was
forgetting
her, he
was in love
with
    someone else !  How
    right
    people
    had
    been, to
    warn
    her
    that
he
'd make her unhappy!  And she always ended by asking him
to
give
her
a
new
tonic and a
little
more
love.
